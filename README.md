# fitbit-rhr-fetcher
This is a Fitbit OS (watch+companion) app that fetches 18 months of daily resting heart-rate stats from Fitbit's servers, then uploads it to a private server.

The app's Settings contains a link that provides the user with a copy of their data.

To run this:
* give it a UUID
* populate all obfuscated variables (search for 'obfuscated')
* rename and upload the .php file to your php server
